# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project**: Citizen Scheme Assistant (नागरिक योजना सहायक)  
**Hackathon Problem Statement**: 2 — Multilingual Citizen Scheme Eligibility & Application Assistant  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Version**: 1.0.0  

---

## 1. Problem Overview
Hundreds of millions of citizens across India qualify for central and state welfare initiatives (pensions, healthcare coverage, farming income support, vendor credit, housing subsidies). However, uptake remains low because:
1. Eligibility rules are buried in dense official government jargon.
2. Central and state rules often differ or overlap in complex ways.
3. Information is fragmented across dozens of departmental websites.
4. Language barriers: Many citizens are comfortable only in spoken or written Hindi and feel intimidated by complex bureaucratic forms.
5. High penalty for errors: Telling someone they qualify when they do not causes wasted travel, loss of daily wages, and disappointment. Telling someone they do not qualify when they do robs them of essential welfare.

## 2. Target User & Environment Constraints

### Primary Persona: Suresh (The Citizen)
- **Profile**: 42-year-old smallholder farmer or street vendor based in a tier-2/3 district.
- **Language**: Comfortably speaks and understands conversational Hindi. Struggles with English and formal Sanskritized/bureaucratic Hindi terminology.
- **Device**: Low-end Android smartphone (1.5GB–3GB RAM, small 5.5" screen, running Android Chrome).
- **Network**: Unstable 3G/4G connectivity with intermittent dropouts.
- **Context of Use**: Often using a shared or borrowed smartphone (e.g., from a son, neighbor, or local shopkeeper/CSC kiosk). Needs confidence that their personal financial details will not remain on the phone.

### Secondary Persona: Priya (Common Service Centre / Kiosk Operator)
- Assists 30–50 walk-in citizens per day.
- Needs rapid screening with minimum questions to recommend schemes and print a concrete document checklist immediately.

## 3. Product Goals & Non-Goals

### Core Goals
- Deliver a 100% bilingual (Hindi and English) experience with instant language toggling at any step.
- Offer voice-first interactions: voice input (STT) for answers and voice readout (TTS) for questions and results in both languages.
- Minimize question fatigue: Dynamically sequence questions so citizens answer only what alters the eligibility outcome.
- Provide crystal-clear explanations: Explain why a citizen qualified (or did not qualify) based on specific rules.
- Maintain absolute intellectual honesty: State clearly when information is insufficient or borderline; **never hallucinate an "Eligible" verdict**.
- Provide official source provenance: Display exact `.gov.in` source links and dates last verified.
- Deliver an actionable document checklist ready for offline saving or printing.
- Zero-leakage privacy: Guarantee that no personal inputs linger on a shared or borrowed device.
- Modular maintainability: Adding or updating a scheme must require only editing a single JSON file without altering application code.

### Non-Goals
- We are **not** an official application filing portal; we do not submit forms to government ministries.
- We do **not** verify identity credentials (no biometric Aadhaar e-KYC or OTP banking integration).
- We do **not** scrape live government portals in real-time during user queries (all rules are pre-structured and versioned to ensure determinism and zero downtime).

## 6. Extra-Points Exploration (Decisions TBD)

The problem statement proposes 5 specific edge scenarios. Our designated responses and approaches are outlined below for team decision:

| Situation | Proposed Strategic Approach | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Unknown Household Income** | Rather than forcing a guess or declining outright, ask deterministic physical proxies: Ration card color/category (Antyodaya/BPL/APL), land area owned, or vehicle ownership. If still unknown, output `UNCERTAIN` and explain the exact cutoff threshold. | Strategy: Proposed (Decision TBD) |
| **2. Contradictory Answers / Unverifiable Criteria** | Display an explicit advisory banner: *"यह योजना स्थानीय सत्यापन पर निर्भर करती है"* (e.g., Gram Sabha resolution). Highlight the exact conflict and provide CSC/Tehsil referral instructions. | Strategy: Proposed (Decision TBD) |
| **3. Shared/Borrowed Device Protection** | Implement a floating "Exit & Wipe (डेटा मिटाएं)" button, disable form autocomplete/caching headers, clear volatile state on browser tab blur, and offer zero persistent analytics. | Strategy: Proposed (Decision TBD) |
| **4. Post-Qualification Dropout Prevention** | Provide clear "Next Steps" (अगला कदम): Where to walk in (nearest CSC/Gram Panchayat), what physical forms to ask for, and what fee (if any) is officially mandated. | Strategy: Proposed (Decision TBD) |
| **5. Adding Another Language** | Recommend adding **Bengali** or **Marathi** based on high rural smartphone density. Validate translations using official state gazettes and NIC portal lexicons rather than raw automated translation. | Strategy: Proposed (Decision TBD) |

## 7. Success Measures

1. **Question Minimization**: Citizen answers fewer than 8 questions on average to screen across 5+ schemes.
2. **Zero False Positives from Incomplete Data**: 0% rate of `ELIGIBLE` status when required criteria are flagged unknown or borderline.
3. **Bilingual Completeness**: 100% of text and audio speech prompts verified in both Hindi and English.
4. **Zero Data Residue**: 0 residual local storage keys or form autofill values after session wipe.
5. **Time to Screen**: Citizen completes eligibility check in under 3 minutes on mobile.

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Speech API browser incompatibility** | High on old Android webviews | Gracefully fall back to prominent one-tap high-contrast buttons if Web Speech API is unavailable. |
| **Government rule changes during hackathon** | Medium | Schemes maintain a `last_checked_date` field in JSON. Rules are decoupled from frontend code. |
| **Dialect & accent variations in Hindi** | Medium | Offer simple numeric/tap options alongside voice input. Handle standard Hindi synonyms in speech parsing. |
| **Team merge collisions** | High | Rigid folder separation enforced by `AGENTS.md` and schema contracts. |
